- 👋 Hi, I’m Kirsten!
- 💙 I like developing with ReactJS and styled-components, but I'm always open to learning 🤓
- 🌱 I’m currently deep diving on React and best practices in front end development
- 📫 Reach me at kmalcaba (at) live (dot) com ✨

Check out my repositories @ odin-projects and frontendmentor for some samples of how I code.

My portfolio site is a work in progress at the moment 👩🏽‍💻
